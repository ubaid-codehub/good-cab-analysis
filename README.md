## Key Questions
1) Top and Bottom Performing Cities:

	Identify the top 3 and bottom 3 cities by total trips to highlight key performers and improvement areas.

2) Average Fare per Trip by City:

  Compare average fare per trip with trip distance. Identify cities with high/low fares to assess pricing efficiency and competitiveness.

3) Average Ratings by City and Passenger Type:

	Analyze average passenger and driver ratings by city, segmented by new and repeat passengers, to identify service gaps.

4) Peak and Low Demand Months by City:

	Highlight the months of peak and low demand to identify seasonal trends and improve resource planning.

5) Weekend vs. Weekday Trip Demand by City:

	Compare trip demand between weekends and weekdays to identify demand variations and adjust operations accordingly.

6) Repeat Passenger Frequency and Contribution:

	Assess the frequency of trips taken by repeat passengers and identify cities driving high retention for targeted strategies.

7) Monthly Target Achievement Analysis:

	Evaluate whether cities met, exceeded, or missed targets for total trips, new passengers, and ratings, and calculate performance gaps.

8) Highest and Lowest Repeat Passenger Rates:

	Analyze cities and months with the strongest and weakest repeat passenger rates to uncover trends and opportunities for improvement.

|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Top & Bottom Performing Cities | Jaipur, Lucknow, and Surat are top-performing cities; Vadodara, Coimbatore, and Mysore are low-performing. | Focus on improving services in low-performing cities through driver incentives and targeted marketing. |
| Average Fare Efficiency        | Jaipur has the highest fare efficiency, while Vadodara has the lowest. Fare per distance varies significantly across cities. | Adjust fare pricing to optimize revenue without reducing demand, particularly in Vadodara. |
| Passenger and Driver Ratings   | Mysore and Jaipur have the highest passenger satisfaction; Surat has the lowest driver ratings. Repeat passengers generally rate higher. | Enhance driver training and rewards programs in low-rated cities like Surat to improve service quality. |
| Seasonal Demand Patterns       | Demand peaks in summer months (May-June) for tourism-heavy cities like Jaipur; business cities like Surat and Lucknow have stable demand. | Develop seasonal marketing campaigns and prepare resource planning for tourism-heavy cities. |
| Weekend vs. Weekday Demand     | Business cities (Lucknow, Surat) show higher weekday demand, while tourism cities (Mysore, Jaipur) show higher weekend demand. | Align driver shifts and availability to cater to peak demand days for business and tourism cities separately. |
| Repeat Passenger Rates         | Lucknow and Surat have the highest RPR%, indicating strong loyalty; Mysore and Jaipur have the lowest RPR%. | Improve repeat passenger loyalty through reward programs in low RPR% cities like Mysore. |
| Monthly Target Achievement     | Consistent underperformance in Vadodara and Coimbatore across metrics like trips, passenger counts, and ratings. Kochi shows erratic performance. | Set achievable monthly targets for low-performing cities and identify operational inefficiencies in Kochi. |
| Repeat Passenger Behavior Analysis | Tourism-focused cities (Mysore, Jaipur) have a lower percentage of repeat passengers compared to business-focused cities (Lucknow, Surat). | Offer tourism-specific services like packages or collaborations with hotels in Mysore and Jaipur. |
| Passenger Satisfaction         | Consistent low satisfaction in Vadodara and Surat across passenger and driver ratings. | Focus on training and incentives for service improvements in cities with persistent low ratings. |
| Emerging Trends                | Growing demand for eco-friendly options and electric vehicles in tier-2 cities. | Pilot green initiatives like electric vehicle adoption in Surat and Lucknow. |
